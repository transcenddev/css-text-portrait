      You don't know, babe
      When you hold me
      And kiss me slowly
      It's the sweetest thing
      And it don't change
      If I had it my way
      You would know that you are
      You're the coffee that I need in the morning
      You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
      Won't you give yourself to me
      Give it all, oh
      I just wanna see
      I just wanna see how beautiful you are
      You know that I see it
      I know you're a star
      Where you go I follow
      No matter how far
      If life is a movie
      Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh
      You're the best part, oh oh oh
      Best part
      It's the sunrise
      And those brown eyes, yes
      You're the one that I desire
      When we wake up
      And then we make love
      It makes me feel so nice
      You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
      You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
      You're the sunshine on my life
      I just wanna see how beautiful you are
      You know that I see it
      I know you're a star
      Where you go I follow
      No matter how far
      If life is a movie
      Then you're the best part, oh oh oh
      You're the best part, oh oh oh
      Best part
      If you love me won't you say something
      If you love me won't you
      Won't you
      If you love me won't you say something
      If you love me won't you
      Love me, won't you
      If you love me won't you say something
      If you love me won't you
      If you love me won't you say something
      If you love me won't you
      Love me, won't you
      If you love me won't you say something
      If you love me won't you
      If you love me won't you say something
      If you love me won't you
      Love me, won't you`;
